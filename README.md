# Optimistic Actor Critic

This repository contains the code accompanying the NeurIPS 2019 paper 'Better Exploration with Optimistic Actor Critic'.

If you are reading the code to understand how Optimistic Actor Critic works, have a look at the file ```optimistic_exploration.py```, which encapsulates the logic of optimistic exploration. The remaining files in the repository implement a generic version of Soft Actor Critic.

# Reproducing Results

The bash script ```reproduce.sh``` will run Soft Actor Critic and Optimistic Actor Critic on the environment ```Humanoid-v2```, each with 5 seeds. It is recommended you execute this script on a machine with sufficient resources.

After the script finishes, to plot the learning curve, you can run

```
python -m plotting.plot_against_baseline
```

which should produce the graph below. Optimistic Actor Critic takes ~6 million timesteps to obtain an average episode return of 8000, while Soft Actor Critic requires 10 million steps. This represents a **~40%** improvement in sample efficiency.

Note that the result in the paper was produced by modifying the Tensorflow code as provided in the [softlearning](https://github.com/rail-berkeley/softlearning) repo.

# Running Experiments

The repository supports automatic saving and restoring from checkpoint. This is useful if you run experiments on pre-emptive cloud compute.

For software dependencies, please have a look inside the ```environment``` folder, you can either build the Dockerfile, create a conda environment with ```environment.yml``` or pip environment with ```environments.txt```.

To create the conda environment, ```cd``` into the ```environment``` folder and run:

```
python install_mujoco.py
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

To run Soft Actor Critic on Humanoid with seed ```0``` as a baseline to compare against Optimistic Actor Critic, run

```
python main.py --seed=0 --domain=humanoid
```

To run Optimistic Actor Critic on Humanoid with seed ```0```,

```
python main.py --seed=0 --domain=humanoid --beta_UB=4.66 --delta=23.53
```

# Hyper-parameter Selection

Note that we are able to remove an hyperparameter relative to the code used for the paper (the k_LB hyper-parameter). The result in the graph above was obtained without using the hyper-parameter k_LB.
